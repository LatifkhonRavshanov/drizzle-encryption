# Drizzle Encryption üåßÔ∏èüîí

Welcome to the **Drizzle Encryption** repository! This project demonstrates how to create an application that handles encrypted data. The application automatically encrypts and decrypts data when reading from and writing to the database. This approach ensures that sensitive information remains secure while being easily accessible when needed.

## Features

- **Automatic Encryption/Decryption**: The application handles data securely without manual intervention.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to existing applications.
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data is encrypted before being stored in the database.
- **User-Friendly**: The interface is straightforward, making it easy to work with encrypted data.

## Installation

To get started with **Drizzle Encryption**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LatifkhonRavshanov/drizzle-encryption.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd drizzle-encryption
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use npm or yarn to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Download the Latest Release**:

   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/LatifkhonRavshanov/drizzle-encryption/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to execute the downloaded file to set up the application.

## Usage

Once you have installed the application, you can start using it. Here‚Äôs a simple guide on how to work with the application:

1. **Start the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Add Data**:

   You can add data through the user interface. When you save data, the application will automatically encrypt it.

3. **Retrieve Data**:

   When you read data, the application will decrypt it for you. This seamless process ensures you always work with the correct data.

4. **Configuration**:

   You can configure encryption settings in the `config.js` file. This file allows you to set encryption keys and other parameters.

## Code Structure

The project is organized into several key directories and files:

- **/src**: Contains the main application code.
- **/src/encryption**: Handles encryption and decryption logic.
- **/src/database**: Manages database interactions.
- **/config.js**: Configuration file for encryption settings.
- **/README.md**: This file.

### Example Code

Here‚Äôs a brief example of how the encryption module works:

```javascript
const { encrypt, decrypt } = require('./src/encryption');

const data = "Sensitive Information";
const encryptedData = encrypt(data);
console.log("Encrypted:", encryptedData);

const decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData);
console.log("Decrypted:", decryptedData);
```
